## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (3.8.1 or higher)
- **Dart SDK** (included with Flutter)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development, macOS only)
- **Firebase CLI** (for Firebase configuration)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Flutter Installation

1. **Download Flutter SDK**:
   - Visit [Flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   - Download the latest stable release for your platform

2. **Extract and Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Extract to your desired location (e.g., C:\flutter on Windows)
   # Add Flutter to your PATH environment variable
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Firebase CLI Installation

1. **Install Firebase CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Using npm (Node.js required)
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Or using standalone binary
   # Download from: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-windows
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd firebase-get-to-know-flutter
```

### 2. Install Flutter Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Project Setup

#### Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or "Add project"
3. Enter project name: `firebase-meetup-app` (or your preferred name)
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

#### Configure Firebase for Flutter

1. **Install FlutterFire CLI**:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase for your platforms**:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   
   This command will:
   - Detect your Flutter project
   - List your Firebase projects
   - Configure Firebase for Android, iOS, Web, and macOS
   - Generate `firebase_options.dart` file

#### Enable Firebase Services

1. **Authentication**:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider
   - Configure authorized domains if needed

2. **Firestore Database**:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Select a location for your database

#### Set up Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to attendees collection
    match /attendees/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow read access to all attendees for counting
    match /attendees/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Allow read/write access to guestbook for authenticated users
    match /guestbook/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android Setup

1. **Google Services Configuration**:
   - The `google-services.json` file should be automatically added to `android/app/`
   - If not, download it from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your apps → Android app

2. **Update Android Configuration**:
   - Ensure `android/app/build.gradle` includes:
   ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

#### iOS Setup

1. **Google Services Configuration**:
   - The `GoogleService-Info.plist` file should be automatically added to `ios/Runner/`
   - If not, download it from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your apps → iOS app

2. **Update iOS Configuration**:
   - Ensure `ios/Runner/Info.plist` includes necessary permissions

#### Web Setup

1. **Firebase Configuration**:
   - The web configuration is automatically handled by `firebase_options.dart`
   - Ensure your domain is added to authorized domains in Firebase Console

### 5. Update Firebase Configuration

Replace the demo configuration in `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your actual Firebase project configuration. The `flutterfire configure` command should have already done this, but verify the configuration matches your Firebase project.
